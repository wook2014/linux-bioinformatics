### Viral Contig Assembly and Identification

+ assemble reads : **metaSPAdes** 3.11.1 (Nurk et al., 2017)

+ contigs>=1.5kb were piped through **VirSorter** (Roux et al., 2015) and **VirFinder** (Ren et al., 2017) 

+ Contigs >=5kb or >=1.5kb and circular thatwere sorted as **VirSorter** categories 1-6 and/or **VirFinder** score >=0.7 and p <0.05 were pulled for further investigation. 

+ those sorted as **VirSorter** categories 1 and 2, **VirFinder** score >=0.9 and p <0.05 or were identified as viral by both VirSorter (categories 1-6) and VirFinder (score >=0.7 and p <0.05) were classified as viral.
